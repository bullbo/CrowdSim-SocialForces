# CrowdSim-SocialForces
Using social forces for crowd simulations in a physics engineering degree project at KTH.

Notice how the brown group immediately turn 180 degrees in the center.

## 8 Groups with 36 Agents in total

Notice how the brown agent slows down to wait on the rest of the group, around frame 80.





The data could be imported to Unity, and be animated in 3D.

## TODO
* Analyze the weight coefficients that is used for the obstacle and social forces.
* Rename all variables to something shorter and descriptive.
* Optimize all calculation methods, some of them are O(n^2).
