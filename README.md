# Simulation of Groups within Crowds using Social Forces
This algorithm is a part of a bachelor thesis in engineering physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology 2019. 

Crowd simulations are useful in a variety of fields including entertain-
ment, robotics and evacuation planning. 

The social force model (SFM) uses a microscopic approach and simulates interactions between single
agents to include group behaviour new group related attraction force that adds cohesiveness within groups
is introduced. 

## Running simulations

## Extract to CSV

### Dependencies

The algorithm has a dependency available for Windows, Linux and OSX.
The dependency include:
  - Numpy

This can be acquired via Anaconda or with  `pip ` using the following command:

  `pip install numpy`
