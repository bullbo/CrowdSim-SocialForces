# CrowdSim-SocialForces
Using social forces for crowd simulations in a physics engineering degree project at KTH.

Here is a section from our report draft on how we managed the orientation problem.

The results are the following
## Unweighted orientation

## Weighted orientation

## Fundamental Diagrams

### Agents removed from sim when destination is reached

The data could be imported to Unity, and be animated in 3D.

## TODO
* Analyze the weight coefficients that is used for the obstacle and social forces.
* Rename all variables to something shorter and descriptive.
* Optimize all calculation methods, some of them are O(n^2).
