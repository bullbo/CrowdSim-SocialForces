# CrowdSim-SocialForces
Using social forces for crowd simulations in a physics engineering degree project at KTH.

For now, run '''Simulator.py''' to test out.
## TODO
* Analyze the weight coefficients that is used for the obstacle and social forces.
* Rename all variables to something shorter and descriptive.
* Optimize all calculation methods, some of them are O(n^2).
