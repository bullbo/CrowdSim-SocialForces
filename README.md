# CrowdSim-SocialForces
Using social forces for crowd simulations in a physics engineering degree project at KTH.


Notice how the brown group immediately turn 180 degrees in the center.

## TODO
* Analyze the weight coefficients that is used for the obstacle and social forces.
* Rename all variables to something shorter and descriptive.
* Optimize all calculation methods, some of them are O(n^2).
